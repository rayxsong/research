We had a meeting with `p5.fab`'s author Blair. It was good to know Blair is working on a new version of `p5.fab` with some features he showed during the Fabrication showcase. 

For us, it was great to receive some positive feedbacks and support by the original author. We discussed about some design decisions, including the target users, if we should build a slicer in `p5.js`, if we should stick with `p5.js` library.

Some interesting projects mentioned during our meeting:
- https://sci-hub.se/10.1117/12.2261648
- https://github.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol
- https://github.com/Heinz-Loepmeier/nozzleboss

We aim at submitting a demo for [SCF 2024](https://scf.acm.org/2024/) by the deadline April 8th.

After the meeting, we have a clearer workflow of the framework. I drew a preliminary work flow to illustrate the two parts of work need to be done, since we are looking for new collaborators to join our team.
1. Front end: handle user interactions and G-Code visualization.
2. Back end: solve layer rearrangement and various printing calculations.
